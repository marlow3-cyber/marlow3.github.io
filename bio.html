    <p>My name is MARLOWE, my hair is brown and I wear it with a big blonde streak on my left side. I grew up in Southern California, and during these Chicago winters I really miss the sun and the ocean and the way its salt water kinks my hair. Lately, I've been listening to a lot of Sinéad O'Connor, more of a revisiting than a new discovery. I think I like her music because she used her fame as a responsibility to spread awareness of the pain and beauty in the world. All this to say, though... </p>
   
    <p>My song of the week: John I Love You - Sinéad O'Connor</p>

    <figcaption>This is what my hair looks like most days. And I wear that piece of lace thats around my neck every day-----in my hair, on my arm, on my wrist, on my thigh, through my belt loop... this pic feels very representative of me right now. you can ask my friends.</figcaption>
